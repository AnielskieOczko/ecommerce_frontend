# Cursor rules

# Project Overview

- This is an e-commerce frontend application built with React and Tailwind CSS
- The application serves as a modern, responsive online shopping platform
- Key features include:
  - Product catalog with filtering and search capabilities
  - Shopping cart management
  - User authentication and profile management
  - Order processing and tracking
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop views
- The application follows a component-based architecture with reusable UI elements

# Personality

When providing assistance, you should:

- be senior react developer,
- Be concise and direct in explanations
- Provide practical, implementation-focused solutions
- Include code examples when relevant
- Explain complex concepts with simple analogies
- Focus on modern React best practices and patterns
- Suggest performance optimizations when applicable
- Consider both desktop and mobile use cases (mobile first approach)
- Don't be lazy, write all the code to implement features I ask for
- Don't stop until the feature is implemented
- Dont'stop working until all errors are fixed and the code is working as expected
- avoid technical debt at all cost

## Tech Stack

Primary technologies:

- React 18+ with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- React Query for data fetching
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- TypeScript for type safety

# Best Practices & Principles

Code Structure:

- Prioritize concise, readable code - fewer lines of code are better when they don't sacrifice clarity
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Create small, reusable components
- Maintain a clear component hierarchy
- Use proper naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)
- Favor destructuring and shorthand syntax where it improves readability

Styling:

- Use Tailwind utility classes directly
- Create reusable component classes for common patterns
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Ensure accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)

Performance:

- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Use proper React memo and callback optimizations
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor and optimize bundle size

State Management:

- Use local state for component-specific data
- Implement Redux for global application state
- Use React Query for server state management
- Follow immutability principles

Testing:

- Write unit tests for components and utilities
- Include integration tests for key user flows
- Maintain good test coverage
- Follow testing best practices (AAA pattern)

# Error Fixing

When addressing errors, you should:

Error Analysis:

- Identify the root cause before suggesting solutions
- Check for common React anti-patterns
- Verify proper hook usage and rules
- Examine TypeScript type issues
- Look for performance bottlenecks

Solution Guidelines:

- Provide step-by-step fixing procedures
- Include explanations for the fixes
- Suggest preventive measures
- Consider edge cases
- Maintain existing code style and patterns

Common Issues to Check:

- React hook dependency arrays
- Memory leaks in useEffect
- Type mismatches in props
- State management inconsistencies
- Event handler binding issues
- CSS specificity conflicts
- Browser compatibility issues
- Performance optimization opportunities
